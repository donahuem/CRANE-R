CRANE Scaling Analysis

10/11/2017
RVs:  Diff(Observed - Expected) of NEC, NCP, deltapH,(carbon spp?) based on normalizations to AFDW (priority), DW, Volume, SA, %Cover
Factors:  Nuts, Day v Night (or Time?)
Mixed effect model
diffRV ~ nuts*daynight + (1|Tank) + (DayNight|DateTimeEx2)

Plot of RV.diff v nuts(3 levels)
Plot of RVdiff v time or daynight
Plot of RVObs and RVexp v nuts in day (panel1) and night(panel2)


Questions:
Do I need to scale the RVs?  These are all differences.

First pass - look at AFDW only

For ME model, including Tank as an RE does not get any variance associated with it.  regardless of which rv.  why is this?  bc this is experiment 2, where there are replicates by tank, there shoud be variability attributed to this level, right?
