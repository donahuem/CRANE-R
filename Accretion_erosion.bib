	pH, global O2 content and integrated primary productivity amount

	operate globally, they display distinct regional patterns. Large
	decreases in O2 and in pH are simulated in global ocean intermediate
	and mode waters, whereas large reductions in primary production are
	simulated in the tropics and in the North Atlantic. Although temperature
	and pH projections are robust across models, the same does not hold

	are predicted to elicit drastic changes, especially to marine and
	freshwater ecosystems. Even small changes in water temperature (1–2&#xa0;°C)
	may alter rates of biological activity, with concomitant effects
	to communities and ecosystems. The biological erosion of marine habitats
	and structures is a rarely considered yet important activity that
	is likely to be influenced by changing ocean temperatures. We conducted
	an experiment to test how seawater temperature affects erosion by
	a non-native crustacean (Sphaeroma quoianum). Aquaria were maintained
	at one of thirteen temperatures (7.5&#xa0;°C–25.2&#xa0;°C). In each
	aquarium, twenty isopods were encaged with an expanded polystyrene
	foam block (800&#xa0;ml) and left to burrow. Polystyrene floats under
	docks are often damaged by isopods in the field. After two months,
	isopods created the longest burrows in the moderate seawater temperatures
	(13.8&#xa0;°C–18.3&#xa0;°C); these temperatures were 1.1–5.6&#xa0;°C
	higher than the mean ambient temperatures whence they came. Shorter
	burrows were observed for the coldest (7.5&#xa0;°C) and warmest seawater
	treatments (25.2&#xa0;°C). These results indicate that increasing
	seawater temperatures can exacerbate the bioerosive effects of non-native
	S. quoianum until a threshold, after which the impacts diminish.
	Because ocean temperatures are predicted to increase 1.5–2.6&#xa0;°C
	in the next 90&#xa0;years, our data suggest erosion by this non-native
	crustacean will increase 14.7–37.6% in Coos Bay/South Slough, Oregon
	(where isopods were collected). However, other invaded bays on the
	Pacific coast of North America may also experience mean increases
	of biological erosion of 6.6–29.8%. Since biological activity is
	tightly coupled with temperature in many species, we hypothesize
	that the biological erosion rates of other erosive species will also
	increase with rising water temperatures affecting marine habitats,
	communities, and structures.},

	m? 2 yr? 1. The highest bioerosion rate and D. setosum density occurred
	at Moon Island, Hoi Ha Wan (HHW) Marine Park. There was no evidence
	of segregation by D. setosum on a particular substratum. However,
	of all D. setosum found on corals, a large percentage (62%) was found
	on the two dominant coral genera Platygyra and Porites. A laboratory
	experiment was thus run to compare the relative susceptibility of
	Platygyra carnosus and Porites lutea, two dominant species of massive
	corals with different porosity and skeletal density, to urchin grazing.
	The urchins eroded 3.3 times more dead P. carnosus skeleton and 3.6
	times more dead P. lutea than the live coral of the corresponding
	species. Bioerosion of P. carnosus was also > 3 times higher than
	that of P. lutea for both live corals and dead skeleton, which was
	further confirmed by a higher amount of inorganic content in the
	feces of D. setosum feeding on P. carnosus than those feeding on
	P. lutea. Cover of fouling organisms (mainly turf algae) on the dead
	skeleton was greatly reduced in both species (? 49% in P. carnosus
	and ? 38% in P. lutea). Our study has provided clear evidence that
	D. setosum is effective in reducing algal growth as well as causing
	coral bioerosion, especially the more porous and less dense P. carnosus.
	The results were consistent with the field observation of severe
	coral damage at HHW where P. carnosus dominated the community, and
	indicated an urgent need for management action to reduce coral bioerosion

	in fossil reefs, but it is difficult to measure directly because
	fossil corals are often incomplete and because it is difficult to
	infer the length of time a given coral was exposed to bioeroding
	organisms. Both nutrient availability and taphonomic factors can
	affect bioerosion intensity as measured in dead corals. Here, we
	examine these two effects separately using data from previous studies
	on bioerosion in modern and fossil corals. Size of individual sponge
	borings accurately reflects total bioerosion in modern massive and
	branching corals on the Great Barrier Reef. Total bioerosion in both
	massive and branching corals decreases outward across the continental
	shelf, paralleling trends in nutrient availability. Size of individual
	Cliothosa hancocki borings decreases across the shelf in branching
	Acropora but not in massive Porites. Fossil sponge borings Entobia
	convoluta and Uniglobites glomerata in massive corals from Oligocene
	and Miocene reefs in Puerto Rico are smallest in Oligocene shelf-edge
	reefs, intermediate in Oligocene patch reefs, and largest in Miocene
	patch reefs. Both facies-related influence, represented by Oligocene
	shelf-edge reefs vs. Oligocene patch reefs, and nutrient-related
	influence, represented by Oligocene vs. Miocene patch reefs, were
	reflected in the size of sponge boreholes. Size of sponge borings
	also varies among species of host corals, apparently in relation
	to skeletal architecture. Borehole size is inversely correlated with
	skeletal density as measured by the relative proportion of skeleton
	and pore space in transverse thin section. There is a weak positive
	correlation between borehole size and corallite diameter. These findings
	contradict reported positive correlations between total bioerosion
	and bulk density in modern corals. Borehole size appears accurately
	to reflect intensity of total internal bioerosion in fossil corals.
	Facies-controlled taphonomic overprints and influence of skeletal
	differences between coral species limit the use of sponge borehole
	size to a rough indicator of paleoproductivity in fossil coral reef

is one of the main destructive forces in coral reefs and is
predicted to be enhanced by eutrophication and ocean acidification
by 2100. The chlorophyte Ostreobium sp., the main
agent of this process, has been reported to be one of the most
responsive of all microboring species to those environmental
factors. However, very little is known about its recruitment,
how it develops over successions of microboring communities,
and how that influences rates of biogenic dissolution.
Thus, an experiment with dead coral blocks exposed to colonization
by microborers was carried out on a reef in New
Caledonia over a year period. Each month, a few blocks were
collected to study microboring communities and the associated
rates of biogenic dissolution. Our results showed a drastic
shift in community species composition between the 4th and
5th months of exposure, i.e., pioneer communities dominated
by large chlorophytes such as Phaeophila sp. were replaced
by mature communities dominated by Ostreobium sp. Prior
the 4th month of exposure, large chlorophytes were responsible
for low rates of biogenic dissolution while during the community
shift, rates increased exponentially (×10). After
6 months of exposure, rates slowed down and reached a “plateau”
with a mean of 0.93 kg of CaCO3 dissolved per m2 of
reef after 12 months of exposure. Here, we show that (a)
Ostreobium sp. settled down in new dead substrates as soon
as the 3rd month of exposure but dominated communitiesonly after 5 months of exposure and (b) microbioerosion dynamics
comprise three distinct steps which fully depend on
community development stage and grazing pressure},

	1.48 g cm(-3), the average of coral and coralline algae). Coralline
	algae contributes similar to 42% of the total gross productivity.
	Bioerosion of coral and coralline algae facies at and near the reef
	surface (estimated from slabbed reef samples) occurs at average rates
	of 0.10-1.15 kg m(-2) y(-1) and releases 1,911 (+/- 436) m(3) of
	unconsolidated carbonate sediment annually. Mechanical erosion (coral
	breakage) likely contributes an additional similar to 315 m(3) y(-1).
	Carbonate sediment is also produced directly by the green alga Halimeda,
	branching coralline algae, molluscs, and benthic foraminifera at
	a combined rate of 1,822 (+/- 200) m(3) y(-1) (using densities specific
	to sediment origin). The total rate of production of unconsolidated
	carbonate sediment in Kailua Bay is the sum of these sources, amounting
	to 4,048 (+/- 635) m(3) y(-1). Normalizing gross sediment production
	(in kg y(-1)) by reef habitat area (in m(2)) generates average rates
	of productivity (in kg m(-2) y(-1)) that are directly comparable
	to each other and to the literature; such rates can also be employed
	and tested in other reef settings. In Kailua Bay, the total production
	of calcareous sediment corresponds to an average (normalized) rate
	of 0.53 (+/- 0.19) kg m(-2) y(-1), with 0.33 (+/- 0.13) kg m(-2)
	y(-1) contributed through erosion of the coralgal framework and 0.20
	(+/- 0.06) kg m(-2) y(-1) contributed by direct sediment production
	on the reef surface. Applying these modern sediment-production rates
	over the 5,000 years that Kailua Bay has been completely inundated
	by postglacial sea-level rise, an estimated 20.2 (+/- 3.2) x 10(6)
	m(3) of unconsolidated carbonate sediment has been produced in the
	system. The volume of sediment stored in the various reef channels
	and holes in Kailua Bay is 3.7 (+/- 0.3) x 10(6) m(3), or similar
	to 19% of that produced since 5,000 y BP. The volume of sand in the
	modern beach is 1.0 (+/- 0.1) x 10(6) m(3), or similar to 5% of Holocene
	sediment production. The volume of carbonate sediment stored in the
	coastal plain is estimated, using core-log data and associated radiocarbon
	ages, to be 10.0 (+/- 1.8) x 10(6) m(3), or similar to 51% of Holocene
	sediment production. The remaining 25 % likely represents sediment
	loss due to the natural processes of dissolution, attrition, and
	transport offshore. These export terms are not well understood and
	emphasize the need for sediment dynamics to be incorporated into
	reef and sediment budgets. Although sediment production in this reef
	system is prodigious, the rate of "new" sediment supplied to the
	beach-face is less than 2% of what moves on and off the beach seasonally.},

	lack of pH data specific to a given species' natural habitat. Here,

	of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal,

	of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with
	characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying
	amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels
	of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO2, often demonstrating
	that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that
	are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward

	Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the
	effects of OA. Both intuitively simple to understand and powerfully
	informative, these and similar comparative time series can help guide
	management efforts to identify areas of marine habitat that can serve

	the Java Sea and Ambon. Bioerosion in massive corals was measured
	by collecting live corals, cutting and X-raying slabs, and measuring
	the cross-sectional area removed from each slab by the various bioeroding
	organisms. A technique analysing branching coral rubble was developed
	and similarly used to evaluate the degree of bioerosion on the reefs.
	This rubble technique has potential advantages over the massive coral
	technique since it does not require the expense and technical expertise
	of making and analysing X-rays, nor does it require the destruction
	of living coral heads. The effectiveness of this rubble technique
	is evaluated here, Levels of bioerosion in massive coral heads and
	rubble from branching corals are each compared with environmental
	variables and health parameters of the nine reefs. Overall, both
	techniques showed that bioerosion levels mere positively correlated
	with environmental variables indicative of eutrophication. Bioerosion
	of live massive corals and of branching coral rubble mere positively
	correlated. At the Ambon sites, where the eutrophication levels differ
	only slightly compared to the Java sites, bioerosion in coral rubble
	was a more sensitive indicator of eutrophication stress than bioerosion
	measured from massive coral heads. The rubble technique we outline
	is a useful rapid reef assessment technique that could be a valuable

	exceeding control mesocosms by 365 +/- 130 mu atm (mean +/- sd)].
	Acidification had a profound impact on the development and growth
	of crustose coralline algae (CCA) populations. During the experiment,
	CCA developed 25% cover in the control mesocosms and only 4% in the
	acidified mesocosms, representing an 86% relative reduction. Free-living
	associations of CCA known as rhodoliths living in the control mesocosms
	grew at a rate of 0.6 g buoyant weight year(-1) while those in the
	acidified experimental treatment decreased in weight at a rate of
	0.9 g buoyant weight year(-1), representing a 250% difference. CCA
	play an important role in the growth and stabilization of carbonate
	reefs, so future changes of this magnitude could greatly impact coral
	reefs throughout the world. Coral calcification decreased between
	15% and 20% under acidified conditions. Linear extension decreased
	by 14% under acidified conditions in one experiment. Larvae of the

	However, there was significant variation in the sensitivity of marine

	Organisms using one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate
	(high-magnesium calcite) can be more resilient to ocean acidification
	than less soluble forms (calcite and aragonite). Additionally, there

  abstract = {This study deals with the colonisation of experimental Porites blocks
	by epilithic and endolithic algal community in two atoll lagoons
	and two high-island lagoons in French Polynesia, exposed to different
	environmental conditions during a 5-year period. A qualitative analysis
	of the community (cyanobacteria and micro-algae) was carried out,
	and the relationship between the epilithic and endolithic strata
	observed. HPLC analysis of chlorophyll pigments was used to quantitatively
	determine the plant biomass, which was then compared to that of the
	algal turf of neighbouring reefs. The results show that these blocks
	are colonised according to two factors: the reef structure (atoll
	or high-island) and the degree of human disturbance. The epilithic
	and endolithic population dynamics differ. The density of the epilithic
	algal community and the species diversity increase with the degree
	of eutrophication and the amount of borers (sea-urchins, parrotfish),
	while the proportion of endolithic species remains low (34 %-59 %).
	This is especially marked in the high-island lagoons, where leaching
	has caused enhanced nutrient levels. An extreme case is the station
	at Faaa, a highly polluted harbour, where increased sea-urchin levels
	(44 ind. m(-2)) meant that the blocks disappeared completely in less
	than five years due to bioerosion. In the oligotrophic waters of
	the atoll lagoons, the losses of CaCO3 by bioerosion do not exceed
	35 % per block, and the algal community is made up mainly of endolithic
	species (66 %-85 %). The algal biomass is lowest in the Takapoto
	atolls (10-11 mu g cm(-2)) and maximum in Tikehau atoll (23 and 56
	mu g cm(-2)). The first microborers to settle in the ecological succession
	of the community are the cyanobacteria. These are gradually replaced
	by Ostreobium (Chlorophyceae borers), which become dominant in the
	blocks exposed to the lowest bioerosion rate. The richness and the
	density of the algal turf reflect the convergence of many ecological
	factors: it seems that the covering of epilithic algae or the richness
	of endolithic flora could be used as a global indicator of the quality
	and the health of a reef. (C) Elsevier, Paris.},

	Internal tidal bores are widespread throughout the Florida Keys reef
	tract, with cool-water episodes influencing reefs up to 10%-25% of
	the time during summer months and with significant variability among
	years. Estimated inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus by internal tidal
	bores to Florida Keys reef slopes are as much as 40-fold larger than

	modification and destruction, and while recent studies in the Pacific
	have improved understanding of spatial variations in macroboring
	community structure, and rates of macroboring within individual reefs,
	comparable studies from the Caribbean are largely lacking. This study
	assesses the distribution of macroboring species and the degree of
	framework infestation across the reefs at Discovery Bay, north Jamaica.
	Although individual species of borers exhibit variable distributions
	across the reef, relative abundances of the main groups of macroborers
	(sponges, bivalves, worms) illustrate clear distributional trends.
	Sponges are dominant at fore-reef sites, while sipunculan and polychaete
	worms are only of importance at back-reef/lagoon and shallow fore-reef
	sites. Bivalves are locally important within back-reef and lagoon
	patch reef framework. Average percentages of internal bioerosion
	(macroboring) vary between sites, but are highest at back-reef and
	deep fore-reef sites. No systematic pattern of variation occurs within
	back-reef/lagoon samples, but a significant trend of increased macroboring
	is recognised with increased water depth on the fore-reef. In addition,
	significant differences in terms of the susceptibility of individual
	coral species are recognised. These factors are likely to result
	in biasing of the fossil record, with variable styles of preservation

	Whereas ocean acidification can increase dissolution of carbonate
	substrates, the combined impact of ocean acidification and warming

	we exposed skeletons of the reef-building corals, Porites cylindrica
	and Isopora cuneata, to present-day (Control: 400 ?atm – 24 °C) and
	future pCO2–temperature scenarios projected for the end of the century
	(Medium: +230 ?atm – +2 °C; High: +610 ?atm – +4 °C). Skeletons were
	also subjected to permanent darkness with initial sodium hypochlorite
	incubation, and natural light without sodium hypochlorite incubation
	to isolate the environmental effect of acidic seawater (i.e., ?aragonite
	<1) from the biological effect of photosynthetic microborers. Our
	results indicated that skeletal dissolution is predominantly driven
	by photosynthetic microborers, as samples held in the dark did not
	decalcify. In contrast, dissolution of skeletons exposed to light
	increased under elevated pCO2–temperature scenarios, with P. cylindrica
	experiencing higher dissolution rates per month (89%) than I. cuneata
	(46%) in the high treatment relative to control. The effects of future
	pCO2–temperature scenarios on the structure of endolithic communities
	were only identified in P. cylindrica and were mostly associated
	with a higher abundance of the green algae Ostreobium spp. Enhanced
	skeletal dissolution was also associated with increased endolithic
	biomass and respiration under elevated pCO2–temperature scenarios.
	Our results suggest that future projections of ocean acidification
	and warming will lead to increased rates of microbioerosion. However,
	the magnitude of bioerosion responses may depend on the structural
	properties of coral skeletons, with a range of implications for reef
	carbonate losses under warmer and more acidic oceans.},

	of 60 d laboratory experiments in which we investigated the effects
	of CO2-induced ocean acidification on calcification in 18 benthic
	marine organisms. Species were selected to span a broad taxonomic
	range (crustacea, cnidaria, echinoidea, rhodophyta, chlorophyta,

	aragonite, low-Mg calcite, and high-Mg calcite forms of CaCO3. We
	show that 10 of the 18 species studied exhibited reduced rates of
	net calcification and, in some cases, net dissolution under elevated
	pCO2. However, in seven species, net calcification increased under
	the intermediate and/or highest levels of pCO2, and one species showed
	no response at all. These varied responses may reflect differences
	amongst organisms in their ability to regulate pH at the site of
	calcification, in the extent to which their outer shell layer is
	protected by an organic covering, in the solubility of their shell
	or skeletal mineral, and in the extent to which they utilize photosynthesis.
	Whatever the specific mechanism(s) involved, our results suggest
	that the impact of elevated atmospheric pCO2 on marine calcification
	is more varied than previously thought.

	of bioerosion in both live and dead crusts by removing carbonate
	from the skeletons (8 to 32 % of the substratum, in volume), they
	indirectly increased bioerosion rate in dead crusts since they are
	themselves exposed to grazing by fish, echinoderms and molluscs.

We investigated growth, photosynthesis and calcification of early epilithic algal community assemblages exposed for 6 months to four temperature profiles (−1.1, {\textpm}0.0, +0.9, +1.6 {\textdegree}C) that were crossed with four carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) levels (360, 440, 650, 940 {\textmu}atm), under flow-through conditions and natural light regimes. Additionally, we compared the cover of heavily calcified crustose coralline algae (CCA) and lightly calcified red algae of the genus Peyssonnelia among treatments. Increase in cover of epilithic communities showed optima under moderately elevated temperatures and present pCO2, while cover strongly decreased under high temperatures and high-pCO2 conditions, particularly due to decreasing cover of CCA. Similarly, community calcification rates were strongly decreased at high pCO2 under both measured temperatures. While final cover of CCA decreased under high temperature and pCO2 (additive negative effects), cover of Peyssonnelia spp. increased at high compared to annual average and moderately elevated temperatures. Thus, cover of Peyssonnelia spp. increased in treatment combinations with less CCA, which was supported by a significant negative correlation between organism groups. The different susceptibility to stressors most likely derived from a different calcification intensity and/or mineral. Notably, growth of the epilithic communities and final cover of CCA were strongly decreased under reduced-pCO2 conditions compared to the present. Thus, CCA may have acclimatized from past to present-day pCO2 conditions, and changes in carbonate chemistry, regardless in which direction, negatively affect them. However, if epilithic organisms cannot further acclimatize to OW and OA, the interacting effects of both factors may change epilithic communities in the future, thereby likely leading to reduced reef stability and recovery.},
